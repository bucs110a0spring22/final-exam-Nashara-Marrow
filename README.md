Summary of Program:

My program generates random images of cats after the user inputs the words another. Along with the cats there is an API that prints anime facts. 

Most Challenging topic in the course:

I would say having a final project and a final exam , I didn't anticipate this so when it came to finally finshing the project , and then knowing I  had to complete a  final , was alot. On top I feel like not solidifying the basic topics in coding definetly hindered my success in the course maybe we should've moved a little slower when discussing topics. 

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
 The code doesn't return anything I'm not sure why.
